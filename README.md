# QR_Code_Scanner

This project has a simple HTML page with a button that allows the user to scan a QR code using their device's camera or upload an image containing a QR code. The Html5Qrcode library is used to handle the decoding of the QR code. When a successful scan is made, the decoded message is displayed below the QR code. The page is styled with a simple, responsive design using CSS.
